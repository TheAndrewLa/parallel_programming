# Overview

Programming assignment for [lecture 2](https://github.com/Svazars/parallel-programming/blob/main/slides/pdf/l2.pdf),
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem.

## Getting started

- Prepare IDE environment (InteliJ IDEA "open pom.xml as project" or equivalent).
- Run all unit tests (it is OK if they fail).
- Read unit tests. Pay attention to CustomSchedulingTest which "wraps" class-under-test (DefaultPhilosopher)
  with custom scheduling policy ("preselected sleeps") to simplify concurrency bugs detection.

## Programming assignment

Implement `DefaultPhilosopher.onHungry` method to avoid deadlock situation. Of course, you should not "hack" source
code,
e.g. you are not allowed to override `DefaultFork` behaviour or replace `Philosopher.eat` implementation.

### Acceptance critera

#### Level 1 (easy)

- `BasicTest.testProgress` pass
- `CustomSchedulingTest.testDeadlockFreedom` pass
- You implemented new unit test `CustomSchedulingTest.testSingleSlow` with custom scheduling:
    - philosopher number 1 grabs both forks and sleeps for one second
    - other philosophers eat very fast (no additional delay)
    - at the very end test system check that at least one philosopher has eaten >= 1000 times
- Your custom test passes

#### Level 2 (medium)

- Level 1 pass
- `BasicTest.testScalability` pass
- `BasicTest.testWeakFairness` pass
- `BasicTest.testWeakFairness` is rewritten as `CustomSchedulingTest.testWeakFairness` using the following rule:
    - even-numbered philosophers eat 10x times faster than odd-numbered philosophers

#### Level 3 (hard)

- Level 2 pass
- `BasicTest.testStrongFairness` pass
- `BasicTest.testStrongFairness` is rewritten as `CustomSchedulingTest.testImpossibleFairness` using the following rule:
    - some philosophers are REALLY faster than the others
    - every philosopher has a chance to eat (you cannot use `sleep 1 hour` hack)
    - this test will fail (`(maxMeals < 1.5 * minMeals) == false`) on **any** implementation
